*After* [introducing the product pass](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/productpass) *a couple of months ago, the most common question I get—other than "Wait, is this for real??"—is how I and others use these tools. So I've put together a short 2-part series about how I use each tool, what I love about it, and what it can help you with.*

*This week I'll cover* [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) *,* [Warp](http://go.warp.dev/lenny) *,* [Linear](https://linear.app/) *,* [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/) *,* [Gamma](https://gamma.app/partners/lenny) *,* [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.link/lpp1) *,* [Descript](https://descript.com/lenny) *, and* [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/lenny) *. Next month I'll cover* [n8n](https://n8n.io/) *,* [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/?referee=Lenny) *,* [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/?utm_source=lenny&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai_bundle) *,* [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) *,* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/pro) *, and* [ChatPRD](https://www.chatprd.ai/lenny) *.*

*My goal here isn't to sell you the products (* [you already get them for free](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/productpass) *!) but to help you get the most possible value out of your paid subscription.*

*If you already use any of these products heavily and have a pro tip to offer, please share in the comments!*

# 1. [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

## What it is
*An agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before. Claude Code understands your codebase, handles git workflows, and executes routine tasks through natural language commands. It can build features from descriptions, debug issues, navigate any codebase, and even handle multi-file edits across your entire project.*

## Why I love it
*Claude Code feels like having a senior developer pair-programming with you right in your terminal. Unlike other AI coding tools, it's intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows. It can agentically search through your codebase to understand project structure and dependencies without you having to manually select context files. The fact that it integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and command line tools means it can handle entire workflows—reading issues, writing code, running tests, and submitting PRs—all from your terminal.*

## What I use it for
*I've used Claude Code to refactor complex codebases, debug production issues, and build new features across multiple programming languages. It's particularly powerful for exploring unfamiliar codebases where I can ask it questions like a human pair-programming partner. The ability to run* `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` *for automating lint fixes and boilerplate code generation has saved me hours of tedious work.*

# 2. [Warp](http://go.warp.dev/lenny)

## What it is
*An agentic development environment that's essentially a drop-in replacement for your Mac/Windows/Linux terminal. It was originally built for engineers but is increasingly used by PMs, designers, data scientists, and even recruiting teams.*

## Why I love it
*It's truly a magical experience, and unlike anything else I've used. It makes you feel like a superhero. Anytime I run into a problem working in my Mac terminal, AI solves it for me. How did we ever work with computers without something like this?*

## What I use it for
*I've used it to download YouTube videos to convert them to MP3s (for my son's* [Yoto](https://us.yotoplay.com/) *), analyze all of my locally-saved podcast transcripts to find the most-mentioned books, and install gnarly packages with a bunch of weird dependencies. I just tell it what I want to do, and it figures it out. Here's me asking Warp to download the Linear YouTube video below:*

# 3. [Linear](https://linear.app/)

## What it is
*A beautifully designed tool for tracking your team's tasks, organizing projects, and building your roadmap. It even has deep agent integrations, so you can delegate your tickets to an agent to take a first pass at a task. The future is now.*

## Why I love it
*In my mind, there's no question that every startup and modern product team should be using Linear. And at this point, most are.*

## What I use it for
*OK, so I don't actually use Linear, because it's just me. But if I had a team, I wouldn't even consider another tool.*

1. [Linear using Linear to manage their own customer feedback](https://linear.app/now/how-we-think-about-customer-experience-at-linear)

# 4. [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/)

## What it is
*Magical voice-dictation that actually works the way you've always expected this to work. Press the function key on your laptop, talk, and it instantly (and accurately) transcribes everything you've said. Works across Mac, iPhone, and Windows, and with every vibe-coding tool and IDE.*

## Why I love it
*It's so fast, and it's wildly accurate. It understands the context of the conversation, filters out filler words, and learns your unique acronyms, terms, and phrases. If you've tried the native mic transcription on your phone, this is a whole different ballgame.*

## What I use it for
*I've always preferred typing over talking, so I've never gotten into transcription apps, but Wispr Flow changed how I work. Since it's so good, I've found myself using it constantly, especially on my* [phone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487) *. For example, my wife is a big texter, and instead of having to type out long messages all day, I press a button, say it, and send it.*

# 5. [Gamma](https://gamma.app/partners/lenny)

## What it is
*An AI-powered document creation tool that generates polished presentations, landing pages, and documents from a simple prompt. Describe what you want, upload the raw data, and get back a compelling deck/doc/website. And just last week,* [they launched Gamma 3.0](https://x.com/thisisgrantlee/status/1967943621782413388) *, which adds a bunch of really cool new powers.*

## Why I love it
*If Cursor is making engineers faster, Gamma is doing the same for PMs. Creating decks and docs is one of the most time-consuming and annoying parts of most builders' jobs. I also just love* [the story of Gamma](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/technology/ai-silicon-valley-start-ups.html) *—small team, little funding, profitable, and AI-native from day one.*

## What I use it for
*Most recently, I've been experimenting with using Gamma to create shareable summaries of my podcast episodes. Here's* [Ethan Smith's episode on AEO](https://gamma.app/docs/Mastering-Answer-Engine-Optimization-n4gxgak9z9tpzhc) *,* [Ben Horowitz's episode on leadership](https://gamma.app/docs/10-Hard-Truths-That-Built-Billion-Dollar-Companies-onh55jsg26xrzp5) *,* [Brendan Foody's story of Mercor](https://ai-revolutions-hidden-bo-3k6n3li.gamma.site/) *, and* [a peek at an upcoming episode on evals](https://the-rise-of-ai-evals-q62i0s7.gamma.site/) *. I copied and pasted the transcripts, clicked a few buttons, and . . . magic.*

## How other people are using it
1. [Generating custom decks for each sales outreach](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yonathan-cohen_gamma-30-just-dropped-i-built-a-29-reply-activity-7373718410439942144-sKqM/)

# 6. [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.link/lpp1)

## What it is
*Magic Patterns is an AI prototyping tool built specifically for PMs and designers. It's not trying to get you to build production-ready apps or launch startups. It's designed instead to be the best tool in the world at prototyping your ideas using your existing products' styles, getting feedback from customers, and then helping you build a real product in your regular development environment.*

## Why I love it
*I've been playing with all of the popular prototyping tools, and I find that Magic Patterns most often produces the highest-quality, most useful, and most correct results. It's especially great at quick iterations and ideation because it only produces frontend code, so you don't have to worry about random database/infra architecture limitations. I encourage you to do your own side-by-side comparison to see for yourself. I also love that it's not trying to be everything to everyone—it's designed specifically to solve pain points for product teams at large companies, with features like* [using your own component library](https://magicpatterns.link/llp1co) *.*

## What I use it for
*I've used it to create* [this thumbnail preview tool](https://project-youtube-podcast-title-and-thumbnail-previewer-348.magicpatterns.app/) *, and other internal tools I'm tinkering with that I'm not ready to show the world 👀*

## How other people are using it

## Learn more
*Check out their* [website](https://magicpatterns.link/lpp1) *, and build something!*

# 7. [Descript](https://descript.com/lenny)

## What it is
*An AI-powered editor that gives everyone (including product managers!) the power to create and edit professional videos. Use it to make launch videos, design walk-throughs, for LinkedIn posts, etc. You edit videos like you edit Google Docs (wild!), and it now includes an agentic video editor, called Underlord, that makes it even easier to make tricky changes (* [see example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fatemeh-alavizadeh_ever-wonder-how-ai-actually-thinks-about-activity-7350929550232444928-fc6s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABAwBcBhqY8pjVXMxROG-p1CJMLG1fMBWU) *).*

## Why I love it
*I have zero video editing skills and I'm constantly making and editing video and audio. I wouldn't be able to do this without Descript. It's been my tool of choice for over five years now, and I've never thought about using anything else.*

## What I use it for
*I use Descript basically every day. I use it to record my podcast ads and intros to each episode, and my production team uses it exclusively to take my raw podcast recordings and turn them into the videos you see on* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LennysPodcast) *.*

## What it is
*The world's largest mobile and web design reference library. Use it to unblock your design thinking, benchmark your product flows against best-in-class apps, and stay up to date on the latest UX trends.*

## Why I love it
*I wish this existed when I was a full-time PM. I would have saved my team and myself hundreds of hours of screenshotting competitors' flows looking for inspiration and a lay of the land.*

## What I use it for
*I point people to it when they are looking for ideas for optimizing a flow in their product.*

# How to get the most out of your product pass, part 2
### Tips for taking full advantage of the remaining premium products you have access to as a paid subscriber

*Here's part 2 of my guide to getting the most out of the incredible tools in your product pass bundle. This month I'm covering the remaining powerhouse products that are transforming how product builders work.*

# 9. [n8n](https://n8n.io/)

## What it is
*A leading workflow automation platform that uniquely combines AI capabilities with business process automation. It's a visual workflow builder that lets technical teams enjoy the flexibility of code with the speed of no-code. Unlike other automation tools, n8n can be self-hosted, giving you complete control over your data and workflows.*

## Why I love it
*n8n is the Swiss Army knife of automation—it handles everything from simple data syncs to complex multi-step AI agent workflows. What sets it apart is that you can start with drag-and-drop simplicity but drop into JavaScript or Python when you need custom logic. It's like having both Zapier and custom development capabilities in one tool.*

## What I use it for
*I use n8n to automate my content pipeline—automatically processing podcast transcripts, generating social media posts, and syncing data between all my tools. It's also perfect for creating AI-powered workflows that can handle complex, multi-branch logic that other automation tools can't touch.*

# 10. [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/?referee=Lenny)

## What it is
*An AI notepad that makes taking and using meeting notes a breeze. Unlike other AI meeting tools, Granola doesn't join your calls as a bot—it works quietly in the background on your Mac, blending your own notes with smart transcription to capture every detail. When the meeting ends, it transforms your rough notes into polished, shareable summaries.*

## Why I love it
*Granola solved the biggest problem with AI meeting tools—that awkward "who's the bot in our meeting?" moment. It's completely invisible to other participants while giving you superhuman note-taking abilities. The way it enhances your own notes rather than replacing them means you stay engaged in the conversation while still getting perfect documentation.*

## What I use it for
*Every single meeting I take. Whether it's podcasts interviews, team calls, or investor conversations, Granola captures everything while I focus on being present. The best part is how it organizes notes by topic and lets me ask questions about specific meetings or trends across multiple conversations.*

# 11. [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/?utm_source=lenny&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai_bundle)

## What it is
*The most productive email app ever made, now powered by AI. Superhuman transforms email from a time-consuming chore into a strategic advantage. It combines blazing-fast speed, keyboard shortcuts, and AI-powered assistance to help you process email faster than you ever thought possible.*

## Why I love it
*Superhuman isn't just fast—it's email reimagined. The AI features feel like having a personal assistant who never sleeps: automatically summarizing long threads, drafting replies that sound like you, and organizing your inbox so you never miss what matters. At $30/month, it's expensive, but for anyone who lives in email, it pays for itself in time saved.*

## What I use it for
*Managing the 200+ emails I get daily without losing my mind. The Split Inbox feature keeps my team communications separate from everything else, while the AI auto-summarizes long threads so I can quickly understand what's happening. The "Ask AI" feature is incredible for finding specific emails or information across my entire inbox.*

# 12. [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

## What it is
*Your shortcut to everything on Mac. Raycast is an extendable launcher that puts a collection of powerful productivity tools all within a lightning-fast command bar. It's like Spotlight on steroids—with AI integration, hundreds of extensions, and the ability to control your entire workflow from one place.*

## Why I love it
*Raycast has become my command center for everything. Instead of switching between apps, I just hit Option+Space and instantly access my calendar, control my music, run scripts, check my GitHub repos, and even chat with AI—all without touching my mouse. The extension ecosystem is incredible, and the AI integration feels like the future of computing.*

## What I use it for

# 13. [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/pro)

## What it is
*An AI-powered search engine that processes queries and provides responses based on current internet content with inline source citations. Think of it as Google meets ChatGPT—you get comprehensive, up-to-date answers with sources, not just a list of links to click through.*

## Why I love it
*Perplexity has fundamentally changed how I research. Instead of opening 20 browser tabs and piecing together information from different sources, I get comprehensive answers with citations in seconds. The Pro version gives you access to GPT-5, Claude 4.0, and other premium models, plus the ability to upload and analyze files.*

## What I use it for

# 14. [ChatPRD](https://www.chatprd.ai/lenny)

## What it is
*The #1 AI platform for product managers. ChatPRD acts as an on-demand Chief Product Officer that helps you draft comprehensive PRDs, improve existing product docs, and coach you to become a better PM. Created by 3x CPO Claire Vo, it's specifically designed for product management workflows.*

## Why I love it
*ChatPRD is like having a senior PM mentor available 24/7. It doesn't just help you write documents—it teaches you how to think about product strategy, user research, and stakeholder communication. The templates are incredibly comprehensive, and the AI coaching aspect helps you level up your PM skills with every interaction.*

## What I use it for
*While I don't personally write PRDs much anymore, I recommend ChatPRD to PMs in my community all the time. It's perfect for turning rough ideas into structured documents, getting feedback on product strategies, and learning best practices from an experienced product leader.*
