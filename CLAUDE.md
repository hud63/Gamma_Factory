# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Gamma Factory** project - a documentation and guidance repository for working with Gamma AI platform (gamma.app), specifically focused on their presentation, document, and website creation tools. The repository contains:

- Comprehensive Gamma help documentation and developer ecosystem guidance (YAML format)
- Product strategy guides for AI-powered content creation tools
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations for enhanced AI workflows

## Key Files and Structure

- `Deep Link Tree and Instruction Map for Gamma Help and Developer Ecosystem.yaml` - Comprehensive mapping of Gamma's help articles, API documentation, and integration guides organized by functionality (Presentations, Documents, Websites, Social Content, Media Tools, Import/Export, Analytics, etc.)
- `modified_product_pass_guide (1).md` - Detailed guide covering premium AI productivity tools including Claude Code, Gamma, and other development/productivity platforms
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server configuration for Exa AI integration (web search and research capabilities)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code specific settings with MCP permissions and project configurations

## Architecture

This is a **documentation-focused repository** rather than a code repository. The architecture consists of:

1. **Documentation Layer**: Structured YAML and Markdown files containing comprehensive guides and references
2. **MCP Integration Layer**: Configured AI model context protocols for enhanced research and development workflows
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Pre-configured settings for seamless AI-assisted documentation and development work

## Important Context

- The repository focuses on **Gamma ecosystem development** - understanding how to build with, integrate with, and leverage Gamma's AI-powered content creation platform
- Contains extensive mapping of Gamma's API capabilities, help resources, and development patterns
- Includes product strategy insights for AI-native content creation tools
- MCP servers are configured for research and web search capabilities to support documentation and development workflows

## Development Commands

This repository does not contain traditional build/test commands as it's documentation-focused. However, key workflows include:

- Use the configured MCP servers for enhanced research capabilities
- Leverage Claude Code's integration with the existing settings for documentation work
- Reference the YAML mapping file for comprehensive Gamma platform guidance

## Working with This Repository

When working in this repository:

1. **For Gamma-related development**: Consult the YAML file for comprehensive API and feature guidance
2. **For AI tool integration**: Reference the product pass guide for best practices across multiple AI platforms
3. **For research tasks**: Utilize the configured MCP servers for web search and deep research capabilities
4. **For documentation updates**: Follow the structured format established in existing files

The repository is optimized for AI-assisted documentation work and serves as a knowledge base for Gamma platform development and broader AI productivity tool integration.
